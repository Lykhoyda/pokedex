# [react-redux-starter-kit](http://cloudmu.github.io/react-redux-starter-kit/)

This is yet another React and Redux starter kit. However, this project attempts to balance simplicity with developing a real web application that actually "does something useful". 
It demonstrates authentication, navigation, asynchronous data fetching, error handling, and caching and pagination, etc. using the technologies listed below.

But first, the [demo!](http://cloudmu.github.io/react-redux-starter-kit/) It displays information retrieved from the Github API - most followed users and most starred repo's. 
Credentials are user *admin* and password *password*. 

Note the deployed demo may not always be up to date. Check out the latest project and [run the demo](#getting-started) yourself.
Here's a screenshot:
